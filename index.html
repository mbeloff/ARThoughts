          <p class="cri__p">A CRI, certified Ross instructor, is an art teacher trained in Bob Ross’s own instructional
            method in landscape painting, as seen on the Netflix shows “Chill with Bob Ross” and “Bob Ross Beauty is
            Everywhere” - compilations of lessons from his original PBS TV series “The Joy of Painting” which ran for
            31 seasons and over 400 episodes!</p>
          <p class="cri__p">CRI’s are the only instructors authorised and certified by Bob Ross Inc to teach his
            method. Over an intensive three weeks at the Bob Ross Workshop and Gallery in New Smyrna Beach, Florida,
            they are trained in all of the techniques and the proper use of Bob Ross products and can teach any of the
            paintings shown on the series. Using positive reinforcement as a teaching method, CRI's enable an
            achievable mastery of each step, as well as a joyful class atmosphere - “We don’t make mistakes, we just
            have happy accidents”.</p>

            <p class="workshop__p">The classroom is set up with all that you need for your lesson and you don’t need to bring anything other than your happy self. Only Bob Ross products are used, as they are designed to give
              you the Bob Ross experience that you signed up for. Your instructor will explain everything you need to
              know about using the products and about the painting that you will be working on - almighty mountains, a
              seascape, a forest or waterfall scene, and maybe one of Bob’s iconic cabins. Each step of the painting will
              be demonstrated to you, as you follow along, leading you from a blank canvas to a finished painting by the
              end of your lesson, ready to take home and frame.
